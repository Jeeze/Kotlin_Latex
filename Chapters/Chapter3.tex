\section{Orthogonality}
\end{center}

\hspace{1em}Kotlin has a relatively small set of primitives; they are the ones that we would expect from Java, integers, booleans, characters, floats, etc. It also uses the same kinds of data structures as Java such as the Array class. The Array class can be used as expected, that is it can be used with all of the primitive types like so: \texttt{Array<TYPE>}. Maps, Lists, etc can be used in the same way. This leaves us with fairly regular amount of Orthogonality. Since Kotlin is so concisely typed there is only one way in which we can declare these structures. [need to write more here]
