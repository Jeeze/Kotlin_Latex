\section{Portability}

Since Kotlin uses the JVM it is turned into Java bytecode. This means that the portability for Kotlin is very high. As long as the machine that it's being compiled on has the appropriate Java libraries installed it can compile on it. The Java bytecode doesn't tell the computer what to do and instead tells the JVM what to do. The JVM takes that bytecode and executes the instructions in it. The JVM is the middleman between the computer and the code, but because there's a middleman  the code runs slower than a lot of other languages.
